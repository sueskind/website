    <p>
        Hi and welcome to my portfolio site. My name is Jonas and if you went through the sites linked above, you
        already know on what kind of activities I spend some of my free time.
        My - let's say - 'artistic' interests are in photography (travel/nature/architecture), graphical design and
        computer science. I taught those three to myself but chose to study the last one at university, here in Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
        On my pages you can find a selection of my work. I will update them every now and then.
        Of course all the content on this site was created by me.
        The website itself was also made by only me and because I don't have any professional experience in
        (web-)design, you might encounter one or two design flaws (I also don't own any iOs/Mac devices, so Apple users
        get the untested version).
    </p>
    <p>
        <a class="intext" href="nature.html">Nature</a> and <a class="intext" href="travel.html">travel</a> show
        pictures that I took over the years.</br>
        On <a class="intext" href="graphicdesign.html">graphic.design</a> you find my work in Photoshop. I got most of
        my inspiration from YouTube tutorials. (But I promise you, I'm not someone who copies every filter's value
        exactly to the seventh decimal digit into my own project.)</br>
        <a class="intext" href="generativeart.html">generative.art</a> is my attempt to show everyone how beautiful
        algorithms can be. You know, to those 95% that answer "Oh I didn't like that in school." when you tell them you
        study computer science.
    </p>
